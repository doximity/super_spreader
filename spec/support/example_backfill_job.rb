# This class is an example job that uses the interface that SuperSpreader
# expects.  While this job is for backfilling as an example, any problem
# that can be subdivided into small batches can be implemented.
#
# In Rails, your class should be located within under `app/jobs/` and should
# inherit from `ApplicationJob`.

  # This provides support for stopping the job in an emergency.  Optional, but
  # highly recommended.
